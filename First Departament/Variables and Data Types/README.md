# Activity. Variables and Data Types.

### Instructions

Make the following points:

1. For a decimal number, what data type is assigned by default? Print it.
2. Return float to the decimal variable.
3. Declare a `const val` variable with the value of PI and multiply it by 2 times our decimal variable to get the perimeter of a circle. 
4. For the previous example, use a **String Template** to print the text `"The perimeter of the circle is: [result]"` being result our perimeter variable. 
### The slope equation is obtained by the following expression:
$$m = \frac{{y2 - y1}}{{x2 - x1}}$$
5. Express it now with operators.
6. Solve the value of the slope, taking into account that `P1(4,3), P2(-3,-2)`.
7. From the previous exercise, answer: Why does the result obtained differ from the expected result?
8. Find a solution to reflect the result.
