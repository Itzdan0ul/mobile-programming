# Activity. Conditionals, Functions and Loops

### Instructions

Make the following points:

1. Create a function that calculates the area of a rectangle by means of its base and height, implement it in `main`.
2. Create another function to calculate the volume of a rectangular prism (use the area function).
3. Create a function that gives the average of three grades. It must receive two parameters with default grades 8, and the third parameter must not come predefined.
4. Use the average function and discuss what happens if only one grade is entered into the function and then two. Finally, make the function run sending only the third grade with `10f`.
5. Create a function that asks for the measurements of the sides of a triangle as parameters. It must print us the type of triangle:

    - Equilateral: all three sides have the same value.
    - Isocels: It has two equal sides
    - Scalene: The three sides are different

**Note:** Use the conditional expression `if (...) { ... } else if ( (...) {} else { ... }`. To evaluate more than one value in the `if` statement, we must use the logical operators `&&` (AND), `||` (OR) and `!` (NOT).

6. With When identify if the data type is:
    - `String`
    - Int
    - `Double`
    - `Other`.

7. Create and use a function that returns the number of times a name is repeated in the following list of names:
- Pedro Luis
- Juan Manuel
- John Louis
- Mary Agnes
- Romeo
- Ernesto
- Juan Pedro
- Ariadna
- Mireya Maria
- Ana Sofia
- Jos√© Juan
